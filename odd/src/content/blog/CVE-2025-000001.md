### Telegram: More Than Just Memes and Gossip

**Telegram** is not just for memes, gossip, and "Hey, where are you?"â€”it's also a powerful tool for hackers! Recently, **Netskope** researchers discovered a **Golang-based backdoor** that uses the **Telegram API** to silently communicate with hackers. The interesting part? Hackers don't need a separate **server setup** anymoreâ€”**Telegram** itself has become the **Command and Control (C2)** panel! Less effort, more gain!

### Trojan.Generic.37477095: A Sneaky Malware

When the **Trojan.Generic.37477095** malware activates, it first sets itself up in **C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe**. After that, it uses the **API token** from **Telegram's BotFather** to create a private **VIP chat** where hackers can perform a variety of tasks:

- **/cmd** â€“ Execute PowerShell commands.
- **/persist** â€“ Keep the setup running.
- **/selfdestruct** â€“ Destroy evidence of the attack.

For hackers, this is an all-in-one serviceâ€”easy to use and highly effective.

### Cloud Platforms in Hacking: A New Trend

Using cloud platforms like **Telegram**, **OneDrive**, **GitHub**, and **Dropbox** for hacking is nothing new. However, this particular method is especially **tricky** and clever!

So, brothers, be cautiousâ€”stay away from unfamiliar **Telegram bots** and suspicious **files**. Otherwise, your **Windows** could quickly turn into a hacker's playground! ðŸ’€
